<b>Lâ€™AMOUR DE MA VIE,</b>

you are the best person I met, the type of person this world lacks. I love the way how you always understand and empathize. Maisha, You have given me the greatest possible happiness. I know for certain there will not be a single soul like you. You see there is no way your card "amake toh bhulei geso" will ever succeed. So dear remembrance, I'm always gonna keep you within me. There will always gonna be a part of my soul completely belongs to you. 

I have always been a very shy and hard-to-reach person. I have never really liked talking to people that much. With most people I felt like I am wasting my energy. But you came along. Maybe because you are so much like my mother. She has been my best friend growing up. It stuns me how accurately she can read me whenever something is wrong. But I also have issues with her. I spent my life saying sorry to her for no reason. But I love her. Things we do for the people we love. Its never enough. No matter what you do or how much you do for them. You will never feel you are doing enough. I have always felt this unsatisfaction within me. I felt them for you asw. I never could make you enough happy. If it was enough, maybe I would stop loving you.

Now when I look back I can see everything. I see how I fell for you, although I tried my best not to. It was so obvious, I mean you are too good to be true. I never thought I deserved you. Idk why, I just never felt like I have done enough good things to have you in my life. I haven't won a war or conquer something. You are worth dying in a war for. Never look down on you. Never. Don't make anything or anyone ever make you feel like, you dont deserve something. You deserve every happiness there ever was. Never settle for anything less. Work on yourself and take the best care. Never stop being kind, never let anything change you. Kindness wont give you enough in return, might even bring you torment but you must stay beautiful. My pretty girl, please be always good to yourself and never give up on you. Life may disappoint you in a lot of ways but be gentle to yourself. We know very little about what to come. So no matter how deep you fall, just know that someone's praying for your comeback.

I'm sorry I have to take this website down. But I'm afraid I might just have a break down anytime and say things that will hurt both of us. Or maybe we'll just fall into pattern and wont be able to say goodbye until it creates a mess. I don't want you to stuck here . I want you to move on , have certainty in life. I want you to be happy. And you know, if there is any need I am always one call apart.
